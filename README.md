# Unhandled JSON Response Exception in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications: improperly handling exceptions during asynchronous operations, specifically when parsing JSON responses from external APIs.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API. It fails to properly handle cases where the JSON response might not be in the expected format, potentially leading to runtime errors.

The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to resolve this by implementing comprehensive error handling and type checking.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.dart` file.
3. Observe the exception if the API response is not a list or contains unexpected data.

## Solution

The solution improves the error handling by:

- Checking the type of `jsonResponse` before accessing its elements.
- Handling various error scenarios (e.g., network errors, JSON parsing errors) to prevent app crashes.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in real-world applications to enhance their reliability and prevent unexpected failures.
